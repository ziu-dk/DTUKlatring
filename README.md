DTUKlatring
===========

This is the small website of a climbing club in Denmark.

The website is provided here as a case study for simple websites.


The old website was run on a classic CMS solution. This was heavy considered that all content was added as raw HTML. This was both unecesarilly complicated but also slow and error prone.

This website is an attempt to do things as easy as possible, with as little maintenance as possible. Furthermore the nature of the source control ensures no single point of failure (hard lesson learned).

The website has simple requirements:
- Serve static pages.
- Content must be viewable before publishing.
- Website must be available in two languages (English and Danish).


Since DTUKlatring is an association under DTU, their design manual might inspire..
